Schema Design
=============
My design of schema shows how much I believe in data normalization. I have chosen id for each table and used that to link datas. Also about manufacrurer again I put that into separate table as there are similarity of manufacturer in csv file and it makes sense to use the id in item rather than the name.

There might be a question about how much joins I need to get data and that might slow down the performance. By having few indecies it's possible to overcome the performance issue.
